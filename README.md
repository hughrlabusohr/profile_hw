# Github Profile HW Assignment

In this assignment we created a Ruby on Rails App with a form text field where it asked the user to submit their Github User Name and when they pressed enter it would submit the user name.

The second part of the assignment was to take the Github API for a user's (the name submitted) repo and parse the json returned to try and recreate the Github Repository page for that user.
